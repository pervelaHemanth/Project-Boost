# Project Boost

**Help the rocket reach the landing pad safely!**

I Implemented a few new techniwues like responsive UI, Level Transitions(Im yet to study them properly but its  a start) and particle systems. I will use more particle systems for explosion and success. I am planning to add audio soon. 

Right now i have made only 2 levels.

The controls are that you can use the main thruster with the SpaceBar while the left and right thrusters that rotate the rocket can be accessed using A or D keys

## Thank You!
