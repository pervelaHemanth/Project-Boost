# Project Boost

**Help the rocket reach the landing pad safely!**

I Implemented a few new techniwues like responsive UI, Level Transitions(Im yet to study them properly but its  a start) and particle systems. I will use more particle systems for explosion and success. I am planning to add audio soon. 

Right now i have made only 2 levels.

The controls are that you can use the main thruster with the SpaceBar while the left and right thrusters that rotate the rocket can be accessed using A or D keys

## Thank You!

*P.S. I was not able to fix the bug in Space Jam which im very sad about. The Game was working as expected in the Editor but the Build was acting weird. Just a bit more experience would prevent these errors.*
